You can change the words
 of this drill simply 
by editing the files,
 there are three files.
 First is word_drill_1.txt ,
 second is word_drill_2.txt,
 and third is word_drill_3.txt
The program reads the
 file line by line, so 
make sure each line is 
not crowded with words
 beyond your comfort level
