# touch_type
A typing tutor/training program in python
#Instructions
typing basic:
Your left-hand finger 
should be placed over 
the [A, S, D, F] keys, 
and the right-hand 
fingers should be 
placed over the 
[J, K, L, ;] keys.
There's a notch on 
the F and J key, don't 
look just feel for it, 
let your other three 
fingers(on each side) 
fall into line once you 
find it. Always seek  
these home keys
[ASDF] [JKL;] and never 
look at the keys, 
it's a better habit to 
quickly improve. Your 
Tums are used for spacebar 
only, choose whichever 
side is preferable.

# Why i created the app
I'm visually challenged 
and wanted to improve my 
typing as it will aid in my 
coding performance, I 
spend a lot of time coding 
and on CLI (come online 
interface). My targeted 
laptop is offline and didn't 
want to rip off someone's website, 

Needed a clutter free and 
simple no install run 
on python file. No internet
needed on device to run, 
just copy and paste the file locally 

# reqiure python
To check if python3 is install, on command
line(CLI) type: 

python3 --version

click enter, if python3 
is on system it will 
return a version number
type to run from CLI, 
note: navigate folder
containing the files
 
 python3 typing.py
