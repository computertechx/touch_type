# touch_type
A typing tutor/training program in python

# Why i created the app
I'm visually challenged 
and wanted to improve my 
typing as it will aid in my 
coding performance, I 
spend a lot of time coding 
and on CLI (come online 
interface). My targeted 
laptop is offline and didn't 
want to rip off someone's website, 

Needed a clutter free and 
simple no install run 
on python file. No internet
needed on device to run, 
just copy and paste the file locally 

# reqiure python
To check if python3 is install, on command
line(CLI) type: 

python3 --version

click enter, if python3 
is on system it will 
return a version number
type to run from CLI, 
note: navigate folder
containing the files
 
 python3 typing.py
